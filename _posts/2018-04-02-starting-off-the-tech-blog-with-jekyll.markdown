After thinking about creating a site to blog about technology and self-learning programming languages, it was difficult to choose which way to go about it. 

Whether to choose **`Wordpress`**,**`Medium`**, or **`Jekyll`**.

After researching for a couple hours, I decided that using Jekyll would be the best way to start using a blog in which I can self-maintain without relying on hosting services and limited functionality of others.

**`Wordpress`** has 2 ways you can choose to start a blogging website. 

1) By using the service from wordpress.com, your web address becomes long with the wordpress.com attached to it. This is entirely maintained by wordpress and is limited. This service is free.

2) The other way is to create your own web address by making your own domain and hosting, which costs a subscription of $5-10 depending on what it is. Since you are installing the plugin onto your own link, you have a lot more functionality than when it is being maintained by WP.

**`Medium`**

I've never actually used medium before; however, I've seen a lot of tech people using medium as their go-to blogs. I've read that a lot of these people are biased and tend to be the case because the styling and format is "cool". People have been saying how there are also limits to using this platform as well as needing to have an account in order to post comments on the posts.

**`Jekyll`**

Jekyll is a *`static site`* which is a site with text files.  It takes page templates and combines them with other information to generate full HTML pages. Database isn't used to store information, so this makes storing and managing easier, as you keep it locally. Jekyll helps you create static site files. Loading time is faster compared to the other sites because it is not managed through a database.

â€‹	This makes things seem more professional for portfolios or blogs.

It's a great thing that Jekyll works perfectly with `GitHub Pages`. It makes creating a personal website and a blog easier to create and manage. 



I'm glad that I chose to use `Jekyll` because it'll help me learn more about the software. Finding the right themes will take a while; however, it'll be a great experience researching through information and tutorials.
